<hr>

**HTML:** Since this game was built with web technologies, HTML is unavoidable; It is used to create the structure of the game and as well as every single element in the project.

**CSS:** It is used to define the visual styles of the game's assets, such as the appearance of the enemies and other game elements, menu screens, and the entire web layout.

**Bootstrap:** It is used to develop the game's landing page and menu screens.

**JavaScript:** It is the primary programming language used to create the gameplay mechanisms and interactive elements of the game, things as the movement and behavior of the player character and enemies, as well as the logic for solving math puzzles and navigating through the levels. Additionally, it is used to implement features, such as audio and visual effects, and to interact with APIs or libraries. For example, the Smile API is accessed using JavaScript code to generate math puzzles.

**jQuery:** It is used to speed up some logical development in the game, mainly for effects like slide-up, slide-down, fade-in, and fade-out game objects.

**PHP:** Escape The Village is a collaborative game that allows multiple players to play together and compete against each other. In this case, the game includes features such as a built-in leaderboard that shows the ranking of players based on their scores and other performance metrics. The game stores player data and game progress in a database; it includes things like the player's levels, scores, and other performance metrics, as well as any additional information that is relevant to the game, such as the player's profile or settings. PHP is used to create server-side scripts that handle the communication between the game's client-side code (written in JavaScript) and the game's database and is used to make other server-side functionality for the game, such as handling user authentication and authorization.

**MySQL:** This game needs database to store all players information.

**Smile API:** Smile API is used to generate math puzzles for the game; it generates questions (Math Puzzles) as images and returns puzzle images and the correct answer; this API is used in the JavaScript when the player touches the door; JavaScript requests this API, then this API will return puzzle images and the correct answer, this api is available in the following URL: https://marcconrad.com/uob/smile/doc.php. This API belonged to the University of Bedfordshire (UOB) and was published by Marc Conrad in 2022.

**PHPMailer:** It is a library for PHP that allows developers to send email messages from a PHP application or website. It provides a simple and convenient way to send emails using PHP, this library is used for OTP number sending, and password resetting purposes.

**Google SMTP Server:** It is a service provided by Google that allows users to send email messages using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP is a standard protocol for sending email messages used by most email servers and clients.

**Python:** It is used to generate html codes to make game objects, enemies, coins, diamonds in random locations in all levels.

## Setup

**Note:** To setup this project in production, PHP, MySQL, Google SMTP Server and web server is needed.

### Setup Database

This project is using MySQL database. Therefore, MySQL database engine is needed for this projects, the database file is found under the **"0-database"** folder.

**Step 01:** Database name: escape-the-village | Craete an empty database with the name of **escape-the-village**

- <img src="github-readme-content/1-create-database.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/github-readme-content/1-create-database.jpg" width="500" height="200" />

**Step 02:** Import the "escape-the-village" database that is found under the folder of **"0-database"** into the created empty database.

- <img src="github-readme-content/2-import-database.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/2-import-database.jpg" width="500" height="300" />

**Step 03:** Update the database credentials | The credentials are found under **"1-landing-page-source/php-classes/php-curd-class.php" | From Line 7:10**

- <img src="github-readme-content/3-database-credentials.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/3-database-credentials.jpg" width="500" height="300" />

**Note 1:** Currently, this project is hosted on localhost, if it is setup on any online server, then is important to update the database credentials of the MySQL Server.

**Note 2:** The ultimate goal of the above 3 steps to explain how to setup the MySQL database, other methods of setting up database is also applicable if it is workable.

### Setup Google SMTP Server

This project is using the Google SMTP server to send emails, OTP when registering users, these are the following steps to setup Google SMTP.

**Step 01:** Choose or create an Google Email to use as a sender from Escape The Village Game: (Ex: escape_the_village_game_2022@gmail.com)

**Step 02:** Turn on the 2-Step Verification method to allow the email to send mails programmatically.

- <img src="github-readme-content/4-turn-on-two-factor.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/4-turn-on-two-factor.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

**Note 1:** There are some basic process to turn on the two factor authentication, after turning on, follow the step 3.

**Step 03:** Craete an app password | after creating app password, SMTP server can be setup.

- <img src="github-readme-content/5-app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/5-app-password.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

- <img src="github-readme-content/6-create-app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/6-create-app-password.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

- <img src="github-readme-content/7-app-password.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/7-app-password.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

**Step 04:** Enter the app password and the sender email address in the following file **"1-landing-page-source/php-classes/credentials.txt/"**

- <img src="github-readme-content/8-app-password-file.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/8-app-password-file.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

**WARNING:** If the SMTP Mail service was not set, the game will not work, because it will fails to send OTP when registering.

**Note 1:** If any trouble occurs when creating app password, it is recommended to search on Google.

### Setup Hosting (Host the Project)

The database and SMTP mail services are set up successfully; now, it's time to host the project source on the server. To host this project, any kind of server can be used, but that server should have installed **PHP Version > 8.0**.

**Step 01:** Move all the files and folders of this repo to the server (Public Folder) | 0-database, .git, .gitignore and other unwanted files can be muted, But **"1-landing-page-source"**, **"2-game-source"** and **"index.php"** are the IMPORTANT files.

- <img src="github-readme-content/9-files-and-folder.jpg" data-canonical-src="github-readme-content/9-files-and-folder.jpg" width="600" height="350" />

**WARNING:** NEVER CHANGE ANY FILES OR FOLDERS NAME WHEN DEPLOYING, IF CHANGED, IT WON'T WORK.
